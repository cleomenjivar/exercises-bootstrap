- Repository: `my-recipes-book`
- Type of Challenge: `learning challenge`
- Duration: `1.5 day`

## Learning Objectives

##### Setup, design and manage a database management system
* Perform CRUD operations on a Database from the front end
* Discover a full app setup


## Mission objectives

Hello hello hello Everybody!

Today, we will continue our learning approach of a simple relational database system that speaks with a frontend and a backend application.

On the same topic we already began to work on, you will create today a Coooking book.

You now should start to see the end of the tunnel, but before we continue, we will still train a bit on this topic.

You now have access to your previous code, to some documentation on the internet and your own practical knowledge.

One recipe should have a Title, a Content, ingredients and a rating.

A few operations are to perform with your cooking book.

You need to be able to:

- __Create__ a new entry of recipe in the db.
- __Read__ all the entries present in your db.
- __Update__ a recipe.
- __Delete__ a recipe if you don't want to see it anymore.


To help you in your journey, i would reccomend that you take inspiration from our task manager app code we corrected together yesterday.
The tables are different, but the logic is the same.

You might see that there is no HTML nor css for you today.
You will have to create the basic layout on how will your application work.

I would suggest to start with a

```html
<form>
  <input type="" name="">
</form>
```
tag so you can start adding event Listeners.


If you want to add some difficulty to the challenge, you can play around with https://www.themealdb.com/api.php to have some recipes come from an api before saving them.


### Tips

- Don't forget to create your db by going inside the db folder in your terminal and running:

```
sqlite3 db.nameOfYourDb
```

- Don't focus yourself on the end product, again, the goal is for you to learn.

- Before starting to work don't forget to run

```
npm install
```


### Bonus Challenges

- Play around with more than one table, the recipe Table, the ingredients Table, the Ingredients_per_recipe Table, the rating table.

- add the possibility to fetch data from a recipe api to save them in your own DB.


### Last word of advice

I know this a difficult topic, and I do not expect that it will be 100% understood by everybody at the end of the day.
Brick by Brick the bird makes its nest.
